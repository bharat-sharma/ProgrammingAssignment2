## code for Coursera "R Programming" course Programming Assignment 2.
## this assignment includes two functions that complement each other.
## first function "makeCacheMatrix" creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## second function "cacheSolve" computes inverse of the matrix returned by first function above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
